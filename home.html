               <p>Ingredients:<br>
                    400g (14 oz) of spaghetti
                    2 tablespoons of olive oil
                    4 cloves of garlic, minced
                    1 can (400g/14 oz) of crushed tomatoes
                    1 teaspoon of salt (adjust to taste)
                    1/2 teaspoon of black pepper (adjust to taste)
                    1/2 teaspoon of dried basil
                    1/2 teaspoon of dried oregano
                    Grated Parmesan cheese (for serving)
                    Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)<br>
                    
                    Cook the Spaghetti:<br>
                    
                    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
                    Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes).
                    Drain the spaghetti and set aside, reserving about a cup of the pasta water.<br>
                    Make the Sauce:
                    
                    While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
                    Add the minced garlic and saut√© for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant but not browned.
                    Stir in the crushed tomatoes. Add the salt, pepper, dried basil, and oregano.
                    Reduce the heat and let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes. If the sauce is too thick, you can thin it with a bit of the reserved pasta water.<br>
                    Combine and Serve:
                    
                    Add the cooked spaghetti to the sauce. Toss well to coat the spaghetti in the sauce.
                    If needed, add a little reserved pasta water to help the sauce coat the spaghetti.
                    Serve hot, topped with grated Parmesan cheese and garnished with fresh basil leaves, if desired.</p>

                <p>Ingredients:<br>
                    500g (1 lb) ground beef (preferably 80/20 lean to fat ratio)
                    4 hamburger buns
                    4 slices of cheese (cheddar, American, Swiss, or your choice)
                    Salt and pepper, to taste
                    Optional toppings: lettuce, tomato slices, onions (raw or caramelized), pickles
                    Condiments: ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise <br>
                    
                    Prep the Patties:<br>
                    
                    Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions (about 125g or 1/4 lb each).
                    Form each portion into a patty that's about the same diameter as your buns. Make a small indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb (this prevents the patties from puffing up too much in the middle as they cook).
                    Season both sides of each patty generously with salt and pepper.<br>
                    Cook the Patties:<br>
                    
                    Preheat a grill, grill pan, or skillet over medium-high heat.
                    Place the patties on the grill or pan. Cook for about 3 to 4 minutes on one side.
                    Flip the patties and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes for medium-rare, or longer for more well-done burgers.
                    In the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on top of each patty. Cover the grill or pan to help the cheese melt.
                    Toast the Buns:
                    
                    While the burgers are cooking, toast the hamburger buns. You can do this on the grill or in a toaster until lightly golden.
                    Assemble the Cheeseburgers:
                    
                    Spread your desired condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise) on the buns.
                    Place the cheese-topped patties on the bottom halves of the buns.
                    Add any additional toppings like lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles.
                    Cover with the top halves of the buns.</p>
